## Building my portfolio with intersection Observer

When I first got into learning programming, I wanted to become more noticeable and have a portfolio online that would look simple yet broadcast that I knew how to animate.( well mostly, kind of)

Mind you, I had a lot to learn about animations, CSS and html but still I dived into something that would help my portfolio look cool without too much sweat and tears. That something was called the intersection observer.

The inter- what-now?

Yes. I know. I will talk a little about it and how it works. The intersection observer is an API (Application programming interface) that basically observes all the objects at the intersection of the screen viewport. The viewport is the visbile part of the screen that end users see. We can imagine it with a simple analogy. Think of it as a sea port, when the boats enter the PORT they can be VIEWED by people.

As elements pass across the port we can therefore animate them.

Let's see how we can create a simple portfolio using this effect.

First let's write some html
